# [Business Requirements]
# - Webapp to consolidate past, present, and future ISLP.
# - Needs to be scalable, secure, and cost-effective deployment
# - Use AWS Services to host the webapp (cloud solution)
# - Follow AWS Well-Architecture Framework
# - Needs to be highly available and secure
# [Scope]
# - Will be for RP students and staff (Target audience)
# - Webapp serves as a public/private repository for ISLP Projects, meaning that database and app should be able to accomodate growth for as long as ISLP in RP stands (Future growth)
# [Cloud benefits]
# - Accessible from anywhere at anytime
# - Quick and effecient upload and retrieval of information
# - Since we will most likely be operating a pay-as-you-go basis, in this case, would be more cost-efficient as opposed to traditional methods of data store
